  abstract = {A system and method are disclosed that enable automated testing of a user interface. The testing system includes a machine learning (ML) algorithm to test a user interface. The ML approach includes collecting training samples, creating an ML model and using the model to test the user interface. Training samples are collected by providing the users with diff files with the differences highlighted. A user is provided with options to specify if the differences are acceptable or not. The user classification and other attributes are used to train the model. When a new diff is created it may be fed to the trained network which results in prediction of acceptance or rejection (for example as "ACCEPT DIFF" or "REJECT DIFF") as output of the network. The system eliminates false positives in an automated way and thus reduces time spent by human inspectors to test user interface changes. BACKGROUND User interface testing tool may be used to ensure that changes in an application do not adversely affect the look and feel of it. A broad category of testing for this purpose includes screen diffing. Screen diffing is very useful, but is highly sensitive to noise. For example, a pixel shift of a browser page which makes naive pixel to pixel comparison fails when it should not. False positives are bottlenecks to usefulness of the screen diffing approaches. DESCRIPTION A system and method are disclosed that enables automated testing of a user interface. The testing system includes a machine learning (ML) algorithm to test a user interface. The method and system includes collection of training samples, creating an ML model and using the model to test the user interface as shown in FIG. 1.},

Previous work on VGT has shown that the technique is industrially applicable, but has not addressed the real-world applicability of the technique when used by practitioners on industrial grade systems. This paper presents a case study performed during an industrial project with the goal to transition from manual to automated system testing using VGT. Results of the study show that the VGT transition was successful and that VGT could be applied in the industrial context when performed by practitioners but that there were several problems that first had to be solved, e.g. testing of a distributed system, tool volatility. These problems and solutions have been presented together with qualitative, and quantitative, data about the benefits of the technique compared to manual testing, e.g. greatly improved execution speed, feasible transition and maintenance costs, improved bug finding ability. The study thereby provides valuable, and previously missing, contributions about VGT to both practitioners and researchers.},

  abstract  = {In mobile application development, building a consistent user interface (UI) might be a costly and time-consuming process. This is especially the case if an organization has a separate team for each mobile platform such as iOS and Android. In this regard, the companies that choose the native mobile app development path end up going through do-overs as the UI work done on one platform needs to be repeated for other platforms too. One of the tedious parts of UI design tasks is creating a graphical user interface (GUI). There are numerous tools and prototypes in the literature that aim to create feasible GUI automation solutions to speed up this process and reduce the labor workload. However, as the technologies evolve and improve new versions of existing algorithms are created and offered. Accordingly, this study aims to employ the latest version of YOLO, which is YOLOv5, to create a custom object detection model that recognizes GUI elements in a given UI image. In order to benchmark the newly trained YOLOv5 GUI element detection model, existing work from the literature and their data set is considered and used for comparison purposes. Therefore, this study makes use of 450 UI samples of the VINS dataset for testing, a similar amount for validation and the rest for model training. Then the findings of this work are compared with another study that has used the SSD algorithm and VINS dataset to train, validate and test its model, which showed that proposed algorithm outperformed SSD's mean average precision (mAP) by 15.69\%.},

  abstract = {The concept of User Experience (UX) dates back to the 1990s, but a shared definition of UX is not available. As design integrates UX, different interpretations thereof can complicate the possibility to build upon previous literature and develop the field autonomously. Indeed, by analysing the literature, UX emerges as a cauldron of related and closely linked concepts. However, it is possible to find recurring attributes that emerge from those definitions, which are ascribable to two foci: the fundamental elements of the interaction (user, system, context) and typologies of experience (ergonomic, cognitive, and emotional). Those are used to build a framework. We have preliminarily investigated how UX is dealt with in design by mapping a sample of UX-related experimental articles published in design journals. We classified UX case studies based on the framework to individuate the UXs that emerge most frequently and the most studied ones in the design field. The two-focus framework allows the mapping of experiments involving UX in design, without highlighting specific favorable combinations. However, comprehensive studies dealing with all elements and UX typologies have not been found.},

Two different datasets were used. The first dataset is the RICO data, which consists of 5 classes. The second dataset consists of 600 mobile application screenshots collected from the open-source. This dataset consists of 7 classes and has been labeled and trained on Roboflow. In addition, an automation system was developed to test the object detection models for errors after the version change in the mobile application. With this test automation, the locations of the errors in the mobile application in realworld scenarios were determined and reported. In this experiment, 2 different data were trained in 2 different models, and the data we labeled gave the best result with a mAP value of 0.81 in the YOLOv8 model.},

Therefore, automated testing is gradually replacing inefficient manual testing methods. However, most of the existing mobile applications are not open source code, and testing open source mobile applications is time-consuming and inefficient. Therefore, we propose automated robot testing based on black box testing. Firstly, YOLOV3 algorithm is used to obtain the information of mobile application interface components. Then, the perceptual hashing algorithm is used to identify the isomorphic GUI of mobile application, and the nodes that are the isomorphic GUI after the jump are merged to improve the test efficiency by simplifying the model. The experimental results show that the method can identify the isomorphic GUI quickly and accurately, and can better simplify the interface model and improve the test efficiency.},

The GUI models built based on the recognition results of existing interface recognition methods are too simple and the positions of the interface elements identified are not accurate, which cannot meet the testing requirements of mobile application robots. Hence, we propose an improved interface recognition algorithm based on the YOLOv3 algorithm to solve these problems.

It helps identify visual defects that other GUI testing techniques, such as functional and performance tests, may not detect. While functional testing verifies the correct behavior of applications, it is not effective in catching visual issues. This paper introduces an AI-driven visual tester, a novel approach to visual testing that enhances the detection of visual defects in application interfaces. The tester can effectively test any platform, using screenshots as input. The process begins with object detection in the screenshots, employing two methods: traditional image processing and deep learning. The detected objects are then transformed into a tree data structure for efficient analysis. Object matching is utilized to correlate objects between the reference and updated images. Finally, change analysis and classification are performed to identify and categorize changes in each object, such as translation, scaling, color change, or object removal.},

Also unfortunately, as a result, we often see that many companies reinvent the wheel (by designing a test approach new to them, but existing in the domain) due to not having an adequate overview of what already exists in this area. Method: To address the above need, we conducted and report in this paper a systematic literature review (SLR) in the form of a systematic literature mapping (SLM) in this area. After compiling an initial pool of 588 papers, a systematic voting about inclusion/exclusion of the papers was conducted among the authors, and our final pool included 312 technical papers. Results: Among the various aspects that we aim at covering, our review covers the types of testing topics studied, types of testing activity, types of test artifacts generated (e.g., test inputs or test code), and the types of industries in which studies have focused on, e.g., automotive and home appliances. Furthermore, we assess the benefits of this review by asking several active test engineers in the Turkish embedded software industry to review its findings and provide feedbacks as to how this review has benefitted them. Conclusion: The results of this review paper have already benefitted several of our industry partners in choosing the right test techniques / approaches for their embedded software testing challenges. We believe that it will also be useful for the large world-wide community of software engineers and testers in the embedded software industry, by serving as an ``index'' to the vast body of knowledge in this important area. Our results will also benefit researchers in observing the latest trends in this area and for identifying the topics which need further investigations.},

Our framework uses standard computer vision techniques through a python-based scripting language (Sikuli script) to identify key graphical elements in the screen and automatically interact with these elements by simulating keypresses and pointer clicks. The sequence of inputs and outputs resulting from the interaction is analyzed using grammatical inference techniques that can infer the likely internal states and transitions of the GUI based on the observations. Our framework handles a wide variety of user interfaces ranging from traditional pull down menus to interfaces built for mobile platforms such as Android and iOS. Furthermore, the automaton inferred by our approach can be used to check for potentially harmful patterns in the interface's internal state machine such as design inconsistencies (eg,. a keypress does not have the intended effect) and mode confusion that can make the interface hard to use. We describe an implementation of the framework and demonstrate its working on a variety of interfaces including the user-interface of a safety critical insulin infusion pump that is commonly used by type-1 diabetic patients.},

In this work, we attempted to transition a manual test suite into an automated graphical user interface-based regression test suite using a Robotic Process Automation framework. The study reports on the efforts needed to implement the test suite and test case maintenance efforts. Furthermore, the study reports on bug-finding capabilities and discusses the feasibility of applying Robotic Process Automation for automated graphical user interface-based regression testing more broadly. Due to challenges related to current testing practices within the organization, only a small subset of the manual test cases could be successfully transitioned. The results indicate that the implementation and maintenance efforts patterns are similar to those of previous studies from the literature - even similar benefits and challenges could be observed. These findings suggest that Robotic Process Automation is feasible for graphical user interface-based regression testing, but further (long-term) investigations are needed in this area.},

Yet, these descriptions are constantly missing in mobile UIs. We propose widget captioning, a novel task for automatically generating language descriptions for UI elements from multimodal input including both the image and the structural representations of user interfaces. We collected a largescale dataset for widget captioning with crowdsourcing. Our dataset contains 162,859 language phrases created by human workers for annotating 61,285 UI elements across 21,750 unique UI screens. We thoroughly analyze the dataset, and train and evaluate a set of deep model configurations to investigate how each feature modality as well as the choice of learning strategies impact the quality of predicted captions. The task formulation and the dataset as well as our benchmark models contribute a solid basis for this novel multimodal captioning task that connects language and user interfaces.},

Because activation functions inject different nonlinearities between layers that affect performance, varying them is one method for building robust ensembles of CNNs. The objective of this study is to examine the performance of CNN ensembles made with different activation functions, including six new ones presented here: 2D Mexican ReLU, TanELU, MeLU+GaLU, Symmetric MeLU, Symmetric GaLU, and Flexible MeLU. The highest performing ensemble was built with CNNs having different activation layers that randomly replaced the standard ReLU. A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach was conducted across fifteen biomedical data sets representing various classification tasks. The proposed method was tested on two basic CNN architectures: Vgg16 and ResNet50. Results demonstrate the superiority in performance of this approach.

Since the convolution operator is a linear operator, several generalizations have been proposed to improve the performance of CNNs. One way to increase the capability of the convolution operator is by applying activation functions on the inner product operator. In this paper, we will introduce PowerLinear activation functions, which are based on the polynomial kernel generalization of the convolution operator. EvenPowLin functions are the main branch of the PowerLinear activation functions. This class of activation functions is saturated neither in the positive input region nor in the negative one. Also, the negative inputs are activated with the same magnitude as the positive inputs. These features made the EvenPowLin activation functions able to be utilized in the first layer of CNN architectures and learn complex features of input images. Additionally, EvenPowLin activation functions are used in CNN models to classify the inversion of grayscale images as accurately as the original grayscale images, which is significantly better than commonly used activation functions.},

A common method for finding these faults is regression testing. In most cases, this regression testing process is performed under high time pressure and on-site in a very uncomfortable environment. Until now, there has been no automated support for finding and prioritizing system test cases regarding the fully integrated aPS that are suitable for finding regressions. Thus, the testing technician has to rely on personal intuition and experience, possibly choosing an inappropriate order of test cases, finding regressions at a very late stage of the test run. Using a suitable prioritization, this iterative process of finding and fixing regressions can be streamlined and a lot of time can be saved by executing test cases likely to identify new regressions earlier. Thus, an approach is presented in this paper that uses previously acquired runtime data from past test executions and performs a change identification and impact analysis to prioritize test cases that have a high probability to unveil regressions caused by side effects of a system change. The approach was developed in cooperation with reputable industrial partners active in the field of aPS engineering, ensuring a development in line with industrial requirements. An industrial case study and an expert evaluation were performed, showing promising results.},

  abstract      = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) usually use the same activation function, such as RELU, for all convolutional layers. There are performance limitations of just using RELU. In order to achieve better classification performance, reduce training and testing times, and reduce power consumption and memory usage, a new "Compressed Multi-function CNN" is developed. Google's Inception-V4, for example, is a very deep CNN that consists of 4 Inception-A blocks, 7 InceptionB blocks, and 3 Inception-C blocks. RELU is used for all convolutional layers. A new "Compressed Multi-function Inception-V4" (CM I) that can use different activation functions is created with k Inception-A blocks, m Inception-B blocks, and n Inception-C blocks where k {$\in$} \{1, 2, 3, 4\}, m {$\in$} \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}, n {$\in$} \{1, 2, 3\}, and (k + m + n) {$<$} 14. For performance analysis, a dataset for classifying brain MRI images into one of the four stages of Alzheimer's disease is used to compare three CM I architectures with Inception-V4 in terms of F1-score, training and testing times (related to power consumption), and memory usage (model size). Overall, simulations show that the new CM I models can outperform both the commonly used Inception-V4 and Inception-V4 using different activation functions. In the future, other "Compressed Multi-function CNNs", such as "Compressed Multi-function ResNets and DenseNets" that have a reduced number of convolutional blocks using different activation functions, will be developed to further increase classification accuracy, reduce training and testing times, reduce computational power, and reduce memory usage (model size) for building more effective healthcare systems, such as implementing accurate and convenient disease diagnosis systems on mobile devices that have limited battery power and memory.},

  abstract = {The explosive growth and rapid version iteration of various mobile applications have brought enormous workloads to mobile application testing. Robotic testing methods can efficiently handle repetitive testing tasks, which can compensate for the accuracy of manual testing and improve the efficiency of testing work. Vision-based robotic testing identifies the types of test actions by analyzing expert test videos and generates expert imitation test cases. The mobile application expert imitation testing method uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the behavior of experts imitating test videos, generates test cases with high reliability and reusability, and drives robots to execute test cases. However, the difficulty of estimating multi-dimensional gestures in 2D images leads to complex algorithm steps, including tracking, detection, and recognition of dynamic gestures. Hence, this article focuses on the analysis and recognition of test actions in mobile application robot testing. Combined with the improved YOLOv5 algorithm and the ResNet-152 algorithm, a visual modeling method of mobile application test action based on machine vision is proposed. The precise localization of the hand is accomplished by injecting dynamic anchors, attention mechanism, and the weighted boxes fusion in the YOLOv5 algorithm. The improved algorithm recognition accuracy increased from 82.6\% to 94.8\%. By introducing the pyramid context awareness mechanism into the ResNet-152 algorithm, the accuracy of test action classification is improved. The accuracy of the test action classification was improved from 72.57\% to 76.84\%. Experiments show that this method can reduce the probability of multiple detections and missed detection of test actions, and improve the accuracy of test action recognition.},

  abstract      = {Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) typically use the same activation function (usually ReLU) for all neurons with non-linear mapping operations. For example, the deep convolutional architecture Inception-v4 uses ReLU. To improve the classification performance of traditional CNNs, a new "Multi-function Convolutional Neural Network" (MCNN) is created by using different activation functions for different neurons. For n neurons and m different activation functions, there are a total of mn - m MCNNs and only m traditional CNNs. Therefore, the best model is very likely to be chosen from MCNNs because there are mn - 2m more MCNNs than traditional CNNs. For performance analysis, two different datasets for two applications (classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST database and classifying brain MRI images into one of the four stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD)) are used. For both applications, an activation function is randomly selected for each layer of a MCNN. For the AD diagnosis application, MCNNs using a newly created multi-function Inception-v4 architecture are constructed. Overall, simulations show that MCNNs can outperform traditional CNNs in terms of multi-class classification accuracy for both applications. An important future research work will be to efficiently select the best MCNN from mn - m candidate MCNNs. Current CNN software only provides users with partial functionality of MCNNs since different layers can use different activation functions but not individual neurons in the same layer. Thus, modifying current CNN software systems such as ResNets, DenseNets, and Dual Path Networks by using multiple activation functions and developing more effective and faster MCNN software systems and tools would be very useful to solve difficult practical image classification problems.},
